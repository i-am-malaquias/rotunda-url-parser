# rotunda-url-parser

This is a quick implementation of the requested excercise.

The implementation code lives in `/url-parser.js`

Feel free to run `npm install && npm start` to run the happy path, it will display the requested output in a console table.

`npm test` will run some test cases I thought seemed reasonable within the constraints of the exercise, nothing too crazy

I didn't stick to any particular style guide but tried to keep it generally clean and readable.
